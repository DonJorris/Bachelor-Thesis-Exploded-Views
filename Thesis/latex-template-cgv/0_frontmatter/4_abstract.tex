\newcommand*{\Abstreng}{In this work, it is examined how explosion views can be utilized to avoid occlusion during immersive cell exploration in virtual space. To achieve this, a literature review of related work is conducted and four promising methods are derived. Furthermore, it is tested how time-varying data can be displayed with explosion views and which interaction possibilities of the Virtual Reality are useful for the exploration of these. The findings are then implemented and compared in a prototype. The usability and effectiveness of the methods is then evaluated by two experts and a performance analysis of the prototype is made.}
