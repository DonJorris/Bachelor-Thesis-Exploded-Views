In our approach, a 3D input model is organized into an explosion graph that encodes how parts explode with respect to each other. We present an automatic method for computing explosion graphs that takes into account part hierarchies in the input models and handles common classes of interlocking parts. Our system also includes an interface that allows users to interactively explore our exploded views using both direct controls and higher-level interaction modes.},

	abstract = {Understanding complex 3D virtual models can be difficult, especially when the model has interior components not initially visible and ancillary text. We describe new techniques for the interactive exploration of 3D models. Specifically, in addition to traditional viewing operations, we present new text extrusion techniques combined with techniques that create an interactive explosion diagram. In our approach, scrollable text annotations that are associated with the various parts of the model can be revealed dynamically, either in part or in full, by moving the mouse cursor within annotation trigger areas. Strong visual connections between model parts and the associated text are included in order to aid comprehension. Furthermore, the model parts can be separated, creating interactive explosion diagrams. Using a 3D probe, occluding objects can be interactively moved apart and then returned to their initial locations. Displayed annotations are kept readable despite model manipulations. Hence, our techniques provide textual context within the spatial context of the 3D model.},
